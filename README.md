# Keyword-Extraction-for-Analyzing-Popularity-of-Algorithms

In research and news articles, keywords form an important component since they provide a concise
representation of the article’s content. Keywords play a crucial role in locating the article from
information retrieval systems, bibliographic databases and for search engine optimization. Keywords
also help to categorize the article into the relevant subject or domains.
Conventional approaches of extracting keywords involve manual assignment of keywords based on
the article content and the authors’ judgment. This involves a lot of time and effort and also may not
be accurate in terms of selecting the appropriate keywords. With the emergence of Natural Language
Processing (NLP), keyword extraction has evolved into being effective as well as efficient.

In this project, we’ll be using SparkML on a collection of research papers to extract keywords in order to deduce popularity of Algorithms used.

## Data
In this project, we will be extracting keywords from a dataset that contains about 7939 research papers.
The dataset is from *Kaggle - (NIPS Paper)2. Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS)* is one
of the top machine learning conferences in the world. This dataset includes the title and abstracts and
paper text for all NIPS papers to date (ranging from the first 1987 conference to the 2016 conference).

## Technologies Used
MongoDB, Spark, SparkML

### Python Libraries
Natural Language Processing Toolkit(NLTK), NumPy, Matplotlib, WordCloud
